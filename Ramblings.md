- **Three.js** supports [`Sprite`s](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Sprite) and `translateZ`.
We should use it instead of relying on SVG or HTML + CSS.

## Notes to self

- Instead of Danganronpa characters, we could use the following to illustrate the effect:

    - _Guernica_ by Pablo Picasso https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_(Picasso)
        * Copyrighted
        * KAITO: I've always liked this painting.

    - _The Last Supper_ by Leonardo da Vinci https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Supper_(Leonardo)

### Danganronpa lines I like

それに賛成だ
Sore ni sanseida
